# Component Fixes Summary

## üêõ **Fixed Issues**

### 1. **Runtime Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'slice')**
**Problem**: The OurTeam component was trying to access `member.specialties.slice()` but the team members data used `expertise` instead.

**Fix**: 
- Changed `member.specialties.slice()` to `member.expertise?.slice()` with optional chaining
- Changed `member.specialties.length` to `member.expertise?.length` with optional chaining

### 2. **Runtime Error: visibleTeam is undefined**
**Problem**: The `visibleTeam` state was initialized as an empty array `[]` but useEffect runs after component mounts, causing undefined access.

**Fix**:
- Changed initialization from `useState([])` to `useState(teamMembers)`
- Added safe navigation operators (`?.`) to all `visibleTeam` accesses:
  - `visibleTeam?.map()`
  - `visibleTeam?.length || 0`
  - `Math.min(itemsPerSlide, visibleTeam?.length || 1)`

### 3. **Missing Team Member Properties**
**Problem**: The team members data was missing properties like `experience`, `rating`, `casesHandled` that were being accessed in the template.

**Fix**: Added missing properties to all team members:
```javascript
{
  id: 1,
  name: "Aisha Patel",
  role: "Founder & CEO",
  expertise: ["Corporate Law", "Legal Tech", "Strategic Leadership"],
  experience: "15+ years",
  rating: "5.0",
  casesHandled: "500+",
  // ... other properties
}
```

### 4. **ESLint Warnings**
**Problem**: Several ESLint warnings about unused variables and dependencies.

**Fix**:
- Removed unused imports: `CheckCircle`, `Shield`, `Phone`, `MapPin`
- Removed unused variable: `scrollProgress` from OurStory.jsx
- Wrapped `teamMembers` array in `useMemo()` to fix dependency warning
- Added `useMemo` to imports: `import { useState, useEffect, useRef, useMemo } from "react"`

### 5. **Theme Integration Issues**
**Problem**: Some parts of the code were using undefined variables like `isDarkMode`, `primaryColor`, `primaryBgLight`.

**Fix**:
- Changed `isDarkMode` to `isDark` (from useTheme hook)
- Changed `primaryColor` to `colors.primary`
- Changed `primaryBgLight` to `colors.primary + '20'` (for transparency)
- Changed `primaryBgMedium` to `colors.primary + '20'`
